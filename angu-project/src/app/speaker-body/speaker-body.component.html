    <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
    <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags,
         foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end
          with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten
           rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good
            work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to
         be most effective and for designers to feel valued,
          we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
<br><br>
        In Aaron’s 
        session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations 
        that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, 
        departments, and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, 
        how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked
         within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself 
         anywhere else.</p>
