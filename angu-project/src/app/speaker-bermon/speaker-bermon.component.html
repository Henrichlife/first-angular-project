    <h5>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h5>
    <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
         Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to
          stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic 
          interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is 
          even better and faster; it increases collaboration
         and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes.
          Long live rapid prototyping..</p>
